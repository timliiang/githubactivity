What is this:
GithubActivity is a program that tracks all activity an user makes on Github.


How was this made:
GithubActivity was made in Java using the Github REST API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/github-event-types?apiVersion=2022-11-28).
Data extracted from the REST API in Json format was converted with the GSON library.
